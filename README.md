# Git Checkout Branch

Git Checkout Branch (gcb) is a gem for quickly checking out gems based on partial names.

## Installation

    $ gem install gcb

Beware that this will only install the gem for your current ruby environment! If you're using tools like rvm or rbenv, you might want to install the gem globally.

## Usage

```
$ gcb weird
Switched to branch 'my-weird-branch-1337123456'
$ gcb ast
Switched to branch 'master'
```

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/[my-github-username]/gco/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
